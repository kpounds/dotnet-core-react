# Dotnet Core with React Demo

Demo app created through a Udemy course called Reactivities by Neil Cummings with a few minor changes of my own based on perferences. Great for learning to work with Entity Framework as opposed to writing SQL in stored procedures for your database. Also great practice with React and hooks and a few new things I didn't know about MobX.
